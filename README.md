## Apache-2.0
This is the mono repo for the development of my custom built mobile robot. Apache is a two-motor tracked vehicle, powered by a Jetson Nano. The aim of the project is to provide a functioning platform where I can pratice my skills in Robotics, Computer Vision and AI/ML. The first version of the vehicle was createed as part of my bachelor degree Capstone project which you can read about on my ![LinkedIn page](www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-durocher) under education. 

## Code style
I'll try my best to follow the ![google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) but this is an R&D personal project so there will be some spaghetti

## Tech/framework used
Currently the project uses ROS/ROS 2, OpenCV 

## Features SO FAR
* Keyboard control over SSH
* A terrible dead reckning state estimator

## Credits
There will be some barrowed code and I will credit in the files where used.

#### Anything else that seems useful
